#### DATA SOURCE:

Reed D. 2019. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a593a675d644fdefb736750b291579a0. Dataset accessed 11/17/2019.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Introduction**

You're about to dive into some deep data collected from five reef sites in Santa Barbara County, all about the abundance of California spiny lobsters! ðŸ¦ž Data was gathered by divers annually from 2012 to 2018 across Naples, Mohawk, Isla Vista, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado reefs.

Why lobsters? Well, this sample provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) established on January 1, 2012 (Reed, 2019). Of these five reefs, Naples, and Isla Vista are MPAs, while the other three are not protected (non-MPAs). Comparing lobster health between these protected and non-protected areas gives us the chance to study how commercial and recreational fishing might impact these ecosystems.

We will consider the MPA sites the `treatment` group and use regression methods to explore whether protecting these reefs really makes a difference compared to non-MPA sites (our control group). In this assignment, weâ€™ll think deeply about which causal inference assumptions hold up under the research design and identify where they fall short. 

Letâ€™s break it down step by step and see what the data reveals! ðŸ“Š

![](figures/map-5reefs.png)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Anticipating potential sources of selection bias

**a.** Do the control sites (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, and Mohawk) provide a strong counterfactual for our treatment sites (Naples, Isla Vista)? Write a paragraph making a case for why this comparison is centris paribus or whether selection bias is likely (be specific!). 

Although we can see on the map above that the control sights (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, and Mohawk) are relatively close along to the coast line to the treatment sites (Naples, Isla Vista), we can't assume that these sights are completely identical. Without further information about how these sights are nearly identical in relevant attributes, I wouldn't assume that there is no selection bias. Each area has a different human population, which may impact lobster populations. They may also have varying ecosystems and habitats such as sandy, rocky, more shallow areas, more predators, etc. Although selection bias is most likely present, it appears to be a similar enough comparison to make accurate assumptions about the effects of MPAs on lobster populations. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Read & wrangle data

**a.** Read in the raw data. Name the data.frame (`df`) `rawdata`

**b.** Use the function `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package

```{r}
# HINT: check for coding of missing values (`na = "-99999"`)

rawdata <- read_csv(here("data", "spiny_abundance_sb_18.csv")) |> 
    clean_names() |> 
    naniar::replace_with_na(replace = list(size_mm = -99999))

```

**c.** Create a new `df` named `tidyata`. Using the variable `site` (reef location) create a new variable `reef` as a `factor` and add the following labels in the order listed (i.e., re-order the `levels`): 
    
    "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples"

```{r}
 tidydata <- rawdata |>    
    mutate(reef = factor(site, order = TRUE, levels = c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK", "IVEE", "NAPL"), labels = c("Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples"))) 

```

Create new `df` named `spiny_counts` 

**d.** Create a new variable `counts` to allow for an analysis of lobster counts where the unit-level of observation is the total number of observed lobsters per `site`, `year` and `transect`. 

- Create a variable `mean_size` from the variable `size_mm`
- NOTE: The variable `counts` should have values which are integers (whole numbers). 
- Make sure to account for missing cases (`na`)!

**e.** Create a new variable `mpa` with levels `MPA` and `non_MPA`. For our regression analysis create a numerical variable `treat` where MPA sites are coded `1` and non_MPA sites are coded `0`

```{r}
#HINT(d): Use `group_by()` & `summarize()` to provide the total number of lobsters observed at each site-year-transect row-observation. 

spiny_counts <- tidydata |> 
    group_by(site, year, transect) |> 
    summarize(counts = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE),
              mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
    mutate(mpa = case_when(
        site %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ "MPA",
        site %in% c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK") ~ "non_MPA"
    ), treat = case_when(mpa == "MPA" ~ 1,
                        mpa == "non_MPA" ~ 0))

#HINT(e): Use `case_when()` to create the 3 new variable columns

```

> NOTE: This step is crucial to the analysis. Check with a friend or come to TA/instructor office hours to make sure the counts are coded correctly!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Explore & visualize data

**a.** Take a look at the data! Get familiar with the data in each `df` format (`tidydata`, `spiny_counts`)

**b.** We will focus on the variables `count`, `year`, `site`, and `treat`(`mpa`) to model lobster abundance. Create the following 4 plots using a different method each time from the 6 options provided. Add a layer (`geom`) to each of the plots including informative descriptive statistics (you choose; e.g., mean, median, SD, quartiles, range). Make sure each plot dimension is clearly labeled (e.g., axes, groups).

- [Density plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/density-plot-group-ggplot2)
- [Ridge plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/ggridges/)
- [Jitter plot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html) 
- [Violin plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/violin-plot-group-ggplot2) 
- [Histogram](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-density-ggplot2/) 
- [Beeswarm](https://r-charts.com/distribution/beeswarm/)

Create plots displaying the distribution of lobster **counts**:

1) grouped by reef site  
2) grouped by MPA status
3) grouped by year

Create a plot of lobster **size** :

4) You choose the grouping variable(s)!

```

**c.** Compare means of the outcome by treatment group. Using the `tbl_summary()` function from the package [`gt_summary`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html) 

```{r}
# USE: gt_summary::tbl_summary()

spiny_counts |> 
    dplyr::select(counts, mean_size, mpa) |>
    tbl_summary(by = mpa,
                statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean}")) |>
    modify_caption("**Comparing the mean counts and mean sizes of California Spiny Lobsters at MPA and non-MPA sites**")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: OLS regression- building intuition

**a.** Start with a simple OLS estimator of lobster counts regressed on treatment. Use the function `summ()` from the [`jtools`](https://jtools.jacob-long.com/) package to print the OLS output

**b.** Interpret the intercept & predictor coefficients *in your own words*. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the regression results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

```{r}
# NOTE: We will not evaluate/interpret model fit in this assignment (e.g., R-square)

m1_ols <- lm(counts ~ treat, data = spiny_counts)

summ(m1_ols, model.fit = FALSE) 

```

The intercept coefficient is the lobster count when the site is not an MPA (22.73). The treatment plus the intercept is the count when the site is an MPA (28.09). The p-value of the intercept is 0, which is means it is significant. The treat coefficient has a p value of .3, meaning that the coefficient is not statistically significant. 


**c.** Check the model assumptions using the `check_model` function from the `performance` package

**d.** Explain the results of the 4 diagnostic plots. Why are we getting this result?

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols,  check = "qq" )
```

This model check is looking at the normality of residuals. If our residuals were normal, the dots would fall along the green line. Our results mean that are residuals are very much not normal. Because we are using a linear regression model, it's important that our residuals are normal. Our results show that our OLS model is not a good fit. 

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "normality")
```

This model is also looking at the normality of residuals, this time looking at the shape of the curve. If our distributions fell close to the green curve on the graph, we would have a normally distributed curve as expected if our model was linear. Because it's far from being close to the curve, it's clear our distribution is not normal and we should not be using a linear regression model. 

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "homogeneity")
```

This model is looking at the homogeneity of variance, meaning that we're looking at the equality of the variance across our samples. The subtitle tells us that the reference line should be flat and horizontal, but when we look at the graph we can tell that the line is extremely curved in a U shape. This is a sign that our data could be skewed or biased. This is another sign that a linear regression is not the right choice. 


```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "pp_check")
```

This model is looking at the posterior predictive check, meaning that it's looking at how well the model shows means, standard deviations, and quantiles. If the model predicted data lines lined up with the green observed data line, our model would successfully capture relevant aspects. We are seeing that our lines are not lining up because our model is not showing these aspects successfully. This is another sign that our linear regression model is not the right choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Fitting GLMs

**a.** Estimate a Poisson regression model using the `glm()` function

**b.** Interpret the predictor coefficient in your own words. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

**c.** Explain the statistical concept of dispersion and overdispersion in the context of this model. 

**d.** Compare results with previous model, explain change in the significance of the treatment effect

```{r}
#HINT1: Incidence Ratio Rate (IRR): Exponentiation of beta returns coefficient which is interpreted as the 'percent change' for a one unit increase in the predictor 

#HINT2: For the second glm() argument `family` use the following specification option `family = poisson(link = "log")`

m2_pois <- glm(counts ~ treat,
               spiny_counts,
               family = poisson(link = "log"))

summ(m2_pois)

exp(.21) - 1
```

b. The predictor coefficient is .21 on a log scale. When using a poisson regression model we take the exponent of that predictor coefficient and then subtract one. This gives us the percent changed when the treatment is present (it is an mpa site). The results are a 23.36 percent increase. 

c. The poisson model makes the assumption that the mean is equal to the dispersion (variance). When there is overdispersion that means that the dispersion (variance) is greater than the mean. 

d. In the previous model, the treatment effect was not statistically significant. Its p-value was .3, which is over the .05 threshold for significance. In this model, the p-value of the treatment is 0.00, meaning that it is significant in this model. In the previous model, the treatment effect was 5.36, translating to about a 23.58 percent increase from non-mpa sites. In this model the predictor coefficient tells us that the treament effect is 23.36 percent. Both results are extremely close, although there is a slight increase in signficance of effect in the poisson model. 

**e.** Check the model assumptions. Explain results.

The model assumes that the mean is equal to the distribution. By using the overdispersion test we can tell that the dispersion does not equal the mean, meaning that poisson is not a good fit. We also checked the zero inflation, which showed that there were too many zeros in our model, another sign that poisson is not a good fit. 

**f.** Conduct tests for over-dispersion & zero-inflation. Explain results.

```{r}
check_model(m2_pois)
```


```{r}
check_overdispersion(m2_pois)
```

This test shows that overdispersion was detected in the model. The p-value is less than .001, meaning that the test results are statistically significant. We now know that the dispersion is greater than the mean. 

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m2_pois)
```

This test shows us that the model is underfitting zeros and that zero-inflation is probable. That means that the model is allowing too many zeros. This is a sign to us that a glm model was not the right choice. 

**g.** Fit a negative binomial model using the function glm.nb() from the package `MASS` and check model diagnostics 

**h.** In 1-2 sentences explain rationale for fitting this GLM model.

**i.** Interpret the treatment estimate result in your own words. Compare with results from the previous model.

```{r}

# NOTE: The `glm.nb()` function does not require a `family` argument

m3_nb <- 

```


```{r}
check_overdispersion(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_predictions(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_model(m3_nb)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Compare models 

**a.** Use the `export_summ()` function from the `jtools` package to look at the three regression models you fit side-by-side.

**c.** Write a short paragraph comparing the results. Is the treatment effect `robust` or stable across the model specifications. 

```{r}

export_summs(# ADD MODELS
             model.names = c("OLS","Poisson", "NB"),
             statistics = "none")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Building intuition - fixed effects

**a.** Create  new `df` with the `year` variable converted to a factor

**b.** Run the following OLS model using `lm()`

- Use the following specification for the outcome `log(counts+1)`
- Estimate fixed effects for `year`
- Include an interaction term between variables `treat` and `year`

**c.** Take a look at the regression output. Each coefficient provides a comparison or the difference in means for a specific sub-group in the data. Informally, describe the what the model has estimated at a conceptual level (NOTE: you do not have to interpret coefficients individually)

**d.** Explain why the main effect for treatment is negative? *Does this result make sense?


```{r}

ff_counts <- spiny_counts %>% 
    mutate(year=as_factor(year))
    
m5_fixedeffs <- lm(
    log(counts+1) ~ treat*year,
    data = ff_counts)

summ(m5_fixedeffs, model.fit = FALSE)
```

**e.** Look at the model predictions: Use the `interact_plot()` function from package `interactions` to plot mean predictions by year and treatment status. 

**f.** Re-evaluate your responses (c) and (b) above. 

```{r}

# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

interact_plot(m5_fixedeffs, pred = year, modx = treat,
              outcome.scale = "response")

```

**g.** Using `ggplot()` create a plot in same style as the previous `interaction plot`, but displaying the original scale of the outcome variable (lobster counts). This type of plot is commonly used to show how the treatment effect changes across discrete time points (i.e., panel data).

The plot should have... 
- `year` on the x-axis
- `counts` on the y-axis
- `mpa` as the grouping variable


```{r}
# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

plot_counts <- 

# plot_counts %>% ggplot() ...
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 8: Reconsider causal identification assumptions

a. Discuss whether you think `spillover effects` are likely in this research context (see Glossary of terms; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIudsVcYhWGpqC-Uftk9UTz3PIq6stVyEpT44EPNgpE/edit?usp=sharing)
b. Explain why spillover is an issue for the identification of causal effects
c. How does spillover relate to impact in this research setting?
d. Discuss the following causal inference assumptions in the context of the MPA treatment effect estimator. Evaluate if each of the assumption are reasonable: 
    
    1) SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value assumption 
    2) Excludability assumption

------------------------------------------------------------------------
